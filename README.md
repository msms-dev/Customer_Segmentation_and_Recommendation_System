A Deep dive into online retail by analyzing a 2010-2011 transactional dataset from a UK-based retailer.
We aim to amplify the efficiency of marketing strategies and boost sales through customer segmentation via K-means clustering. 
Furthermore, we develop a recommendation system that will suggest top-selling products to customers within each segment.


- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers, preparing it for effective clustering.

    
- **Feature Engineering**: Develop new features based on the transactional data to create a customer-centric dataset, setting the foundation for customer segmentation.

    
- **Data Preprocessing**: Undertake feature scaling and dimensionality reduction to streamline the data, enhancing the efficiency of the clustering process.

    
- **Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**: Segment customers into distinct groups using K-means, facilitating targeted marketing and personalized strategies.

    
- **Cluster Analysis & Evaluation**: Analyze and profile each cluster to develop targeted marketing strategies and assess the quality of the clusters formed.

    
- **Recommendation System**: Implement a system to recommend best-selling products to customers within the same cluster who haven't purchased those products, aiming to boost sales and marketing effectiveness.
